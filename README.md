# Linear-Rregression
## Linear Regression Assumptions
- 1. Linearity

The linearity assumption requires that there is a linear relationship between our target variable (Sales) and its predictor variables. Trying to fit a non-linear dataset to a linear model would fail. This can best be tested using a scatter plot. Removing outliers is very important for this assumption due to major impacts occurring from the presence of outliers. 

- 2. Normality

The normality assumption requires that the model residuals should follow a normal distribution. The easiest way to check this assumption is via a histogram or a quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q-Plot).

- 3. Homoscedasticity

Homoscedasticity indicates that a dependent variable has an equal variance across values of the independent 
variable. Our residuals should be equal across our regression line.
